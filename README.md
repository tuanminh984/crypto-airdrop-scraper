# Crypto Airdrop Scraper

## Overview

The **Crypto Airdrop Scraper** is a Python-based tool designed to collect information about cryptocurrency airdrops from various websites. It gathers details such as the airdrop name, token, requirements, end date, and relevant link. The scraper aggregates this data and saves it to a CSV file for easy access.

### Features

- **Multi-Site Scraping**: This scraper is set up to handle multiple websites, parsing each according to its structure.
- **Data Organization**: Collected data includes essential details like name, token symbol, requirements, end date, and the link.
- **CSV Output**: Results are saved to a CSV file, making it easy to view, filter, and analyze the airdrops.

### Prerequisites

To run this script, you’ll need:

1. Python 3.x
2. Required libraries: `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, and `pandas`

You can install the required libraries with the following command:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
```

### Usage

#### Step 1: Modify Target URLs

Update the `self.base_urls` list in the script to include the actual websites that host airdrop information.

#### Step 2: Run the Script

Run the script using the following command:

```bash
py crypto_airdrop_scraper.py
```

The script will then scrape each website in `self.base_urls` for airdrop data, which it organizes and saves to `crypto_airdrops.csv`.

### Data Output

The CSV file will include the following columns:

- **Name**: Name of the airdrop project
- **Token**: Token symbol associated with the airdrop
- **Requirements**: Eligibility or participation requirements
- **End Date**: The expiration date of the airdrop
- **Link**: Direct link to the airdrop page or project

### Example

If you’ve added airdrop websites to `self.base_urls`, the script should output a file named `crypto_airdrops.csv` with structured information about available airdrops.

### Limitations

- **Website Structure**: Since websites can differ greatly in structure, the scraping methods are custom-built for specific sites. You may need to adjust selectors in the `parse_example_airdrops` and `parse_another_airdrop_website` functions to match actual site structures.
- **Data Accuracy**: This script provides data as-is from the scraped websites and may require manual verification.
- **Rate Limiting**: Websites may restrict excessive requests. The `time.sleep(2)` delay between requests helps mitigate this but may need adjustment.

### Future Enhancements

- **Dynamic URL Parsing**: Extend the script to automatically recognize and parse new websites.
- **Advanced Scheduling**: Implement a scheduled process to run the scraper daily or weekly.
- **Enhanced Data Storage**: Optionally save data to a database for better analysis and tracking over time.
